# A website made with Mianna in January 2018

## what did we want to make

a page with a puppy that links to another page with a puppy that has a list of games we can play

## what did we talk about

 * opening and closing tags
 * why you put classes on html elements
 * why some things are called divs
 * why you search for images in google that have usage rights to let us use the images
 * why hotlinking is rude
